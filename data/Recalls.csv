Product Description: Enovis"" shoulder devices are intended for treatment of patients who are candidates for shoulder arthroplasty per the Indication for use. While total shoulder replacements are not intended to withstand activity levels and loads of normal healthy bone, they are a means of restoring mobility and reducing pain for many patients.

The AltiVate Reverse¿ Shoulder Prosthesis is indicated as a reverse shoulder replacement for patients with a functional deltoid muscle and a grossly deficient rotator cuff joint suffering from pain and dysfunction due to:
"" Severe arthropathy with a grossly deficient rotator cuff;
"" Previously failed joint replacement with a grossly deficient rotator cuff;
"" Fracture of glenohumeral joint from trauma or pathologic conditions of the shoulder including humeral head fracture, displaced 3- or 4-part fractures of proximal humerus, or reconstruction after tumor resection;
"" Bone defect in proximal humerus;
"" Non-inflammatory degenerative disease including osteoarthritis and avascular necrosis of the natural humeral head and/or glenoid;
"" Inflammatory arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis;
"" Correction of functional deformity.

The glenoid baseplate is intended for cementless application with addition of screws for fixation. This device may also be indicated in the salvage of previously failed surgical attempts for anatomic and hemi procedures.

All RSP¿ Monoblock and AltiVate Reverse¿ humeral stems are intended for cemented or cementless use.
Enovis"" instrumentation consists of devices and their accessories used in surgical procedures. Implantation of Enovis"" products should only be performed with Enovis"" instrumentation or instrumentation distributed by Enovis"". Enovis"" instruments and instrument cases are generally composed of titanium, stainless steel, aluminum, and/or polymeric materials. The cases may be multi-layered with various inserts to hold surgical instrumentation in place during handling and storage. The inserts may consist of trays, holders, and silicone mats. The instrument cases will allow sterilization of the contents to occur in a steam autoclave utilizing the cleaning, sterilization, and drying cycle that has been validated and detailed below. Instrument cases do not provide a sterile barrier and must be used in conjunction with FDA cleared sterilization wrap to maintain sterility. Instruments are provided non-sterile and should be stored in their original packaging until cleaned and sterilized according to the recommended guidelines listed below.

Product Description: MEDIHONEY¿ HCS ADHESIVE SHEET DRESSING with LEPTOSPERMUM HONEY is a moist wound dressing made of Leptospermum Honey (+15) in combination with a hydrogel colloidal gelling agent, surrounded by an adhesive border. The gelling agent is contained within the dressing mass. The dressing contains 63%, by weight, Leptospermum Honey. As wound exudate is absorbed, the dressing   which has a low pH and high osmolarity   forms a gel. This assists in maintaining a moist environment for optimal wound healing, aids in autolytic debridement, and allows for non-traumatic removal. This product is an occlusive dressing, and does not require a secondary dressing.

(e.g., rate change or bolus). The level of underinfusion is variable based on the current infusion rate, the duration the pump has been running at this flow rate, and the magnitude of the rate change. The longer the duration the pump has been running at the current infusion rate and the larger the magnitude of the rate change, the larger the underinfusion that would be experienced.   
Additionally, Baxter has identified an increase in customer reports of over and underinfusion potentially due to set misloading. Failure to properly load the tubing into the pump channel may result in the pump infusing at a rate higher or lower than programmed. Consistent with the instructions for use, customers should ensure that:
1) The door is fully open before loading the set.
2) The tubing is taut and loaded without slack in the pumping channel.

Product Description: The HeartMate 3"" Left Ventricular Assist System (LVAS) is a set of equipment and materials that together comprise a medical device designed to provide therapeutic benefit to those affected with advanced heart failure. In service, the LVAS assumes some or all of the workload of the left ventricle, thereby restoring the patient's systemic perfusion while palliating the underlying pathology. The LVAS features a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD), a blood pump intended for long-term implantation in such patients, an extracorporeal Controller, plus all of the features, controls, attachments, interfaces, power sources, supporting equipment, labeling, and tools required to achieve the desired therapeutic benefit.

The HeartMate II Left Ventricular Assist System is an axial-flow, rotary ventricular assist system that generates flows up to 10 liters per minute (lpm). One end of the Left Ventricular Assist Device is attached to the apex of the left ventricle; the other end of the device connects to the ascending aorta. The Left Ventricular Assist Device diverts blood from the weakened left ventricle and propels it to the aorta. A small external computer, the System Controller, monitors system operation. A driveline, which passes through the patient s abdomen, connects the implanted pump to the System Controller. The system is powered by a Power Module or Mobile Power Unit (MPU) that is connected to an AC electrical outlet, or by two HeartMate 14 Volt Lithium-Ion batteries.

The LVAS may be used in any of two configurations. First, line power may be utilized through the Power Module or the Mobile Power Unit (MPU) to run the LVAD indefinitely, convenient for sedentary or sleeping periods. Second, portable Battery power may be utilized for limited periods, convenient for active periods.

The Left Ventricular Assist Device diverts blood from the weakened left ventricle and propels it to the aorta. A small external computer, the System Controller, monitors system operation. A driveline, which passes through the patient s abdomen, connects the implanted pump to the System Controller. The system is powered by a Power Module or Mobile Power Unit (MPU) that is connected to an AC electrical outlet, or by two HeartMate 14 Volt Lithium-Ion batteries.

The LVAS may be used in any of two configurations. First, line power may be utilized through the Power Module or the Mobile Power Unit (MPU) to run the LVAD indefinitely, convenient for sedentary or sleeping periods. Second, portable Battery power may be utilized for limited periods, convenient for active periods.

The MPU AC power cord is distributed either as part of the complete MPU device package or as a standalone accessory.
Component: Yes, the MPU is a component of the HeartMate 3 and HeartMate II Left Ventricular Assist Systems.

Model/Catalog Number: IMU7F-40, IMU7F-35, IMU7F-30, IMU7F-25, and IMU7F-20
Software Version: Not applicable
Product Description: The Insightra Ultra IABP Catheter Kit is a 7 French catheter available with either a 40, 35, 30, 25, or 20 cc balloon. The catheter has two lumens and is designed to provide counterpulsation cardiac assist therapy. The outer lumen is a channel for helium used to inflate and deflate the balloon. The inner lumen is used for a guidewire and blood pressure measurement. It is packaged as a convenience kit with accessories (one-way
valve, 50 cc syringe, guide wires, introducer needle, dilator, pressure tubing, Datascope & Arrow adaptors).
The balloon inflation and deflation cycle is synchronized (using a commercially available control console) with the ECG or arterial pressure to provide counterpulsation synchronized with the heartbeat. It is intended to increase coronary perfusion, decrease the workload of the left ventricle and allow healing of the myocardium
